Installation
============

We advise to download the tools directly from our repo and installing them in place.
Because our tools consist of Jupyter notebooks and Python modules, there is no "clean" method to install from PyPi.

1. Prerequisites
    - python3
    - git

2. Instructions
    #. Download the github repo: :code:`git clone https://github.com/Convex-Labs/honestnft-shenanigans.git`
    #. Change directory to the downloaded repo: :code:`cd honestnft-shenanigans`
    #. Install the tools and requirements with: :code:`pip install --editable .`
    #. Rename :code:`.env-example` to :code:`.env`
    #. Add your personal :doc:`API keys and web3 providers <api-keys>` to :code:`.env`


.. note:: The repo takes a few minutes to install. We've provided a decent amount of test data so the repository is rather large.
