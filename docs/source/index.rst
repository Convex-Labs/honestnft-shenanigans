Welcome to HonestNFT Shenanigan Scanning Tools's documentation!
===============================================================

In October 2021, we open sourced our code for scraping and analyzing NFT metadata. 
Additionally, we developed and published methodologies for:

* identifying shenanigans carried out by insiders
* preventing insider trading through simple but robust commit-reveal schemes

Our powerful suite of tools makes it easy for analysts to collect rarity data and detect what we 
call "anomalously lucky" NFT traders. Since open sourcing our code, it has been forked 60+ times 
and starred 150+ times on Github. We have already paid out over $50k in bounties to open source 
code contributors who expanded our toolset, as well as to sleuths who used our code to shine a 
light on bad behavior in the NFT space. 

Our tools have been used in numerous public investigations. Here are a few high-profile examples:

* `Did the son of the world's third-richest person trade NFTs with inside information? <https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2022/03/30/did-the-son-of-the-worlds-third-richest-man-trade-nfts-with-inside-information/>`_ *Kauflin, J. Forbes 3/30/2022*
* `BoredBunnyNFT Slow Rug investigation <https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1509565586874851330>`_ *ZachXBT 3/31/2022*
