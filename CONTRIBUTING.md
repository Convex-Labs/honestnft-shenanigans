# Contributing to honestnft-shenanigans

Welcome, and thank you for considering contributing to honestnft-shenanigans. 
We encourage you to help out by raising issues, improving documentation, fixing 
bugs, or adding new features.

If you're interested in contributing please start by reading this document. If
you have any questions at all, or don't know where to start, please reach out to
us on [Discord].

## Contributing Code

To contribute bug fixes or features to honestnft-shenanigans:

1. Communicate your intent.
1. Make your changes.
1. Test your changes.
1. Update documentation and examples where appropriate.
1. Open a Pull Request (PR).

Communicating your intent lets the honestnft-shenanigans maintainers know that 
you intend to contribute, and how. This sets you up for success - you can avoid 
duplicating an effort that may already be underway, adding a feature that may 
be rejected, or heading down a path that you would be steered away from at review 
time. The best way to communicate your intent is via a detailed GitHub issue. 
Take a look first to see if there's already an issue relating to the thing you'd 
like to contribute. If there isn't, please raise a new one! Let us know what you'd 
like to work on, and why. The honestnft-shenanigans maintainers can't always triage 
new issues immediately, but we encourage you to bring them to our attention 
via [Discord].

Be sure to practice [good git commit hygiene] as you make your changes. All but
the smallest changes should be broken up into a few commits that tell a story.
Use your git commits to provide context for the folks who will review PR, and
the folks who will be spelunking the codebase in the months and years to come. 
The honestnft-shenanigans project highly values readable, Pythonic Python code. 

Once your change is written, tested, and documented the final step is to have it
reviewed! You'll be presented with a template and a small checklist when you
open a PR. Please read the template and fill out the checklist. Please make all
requested changes in subsequent commits. This allows your reviewers to see what
has changed as you address their comments. Be mindful of your commit history as
you do this - avoid commit messages like "Address review feedback" if possible.
If doing so is difficult a good alternative is to rewrite your commit history to
clean them up after your PR is approved but before it is merged.

In summary, please:

* Discuss your change in a GitHub issue before you start.
* Use your Git commit messages to communicate your intent to your reviewers.
* Add or update tests for all changes.
* Update all relevant documentation.
* Don't force push to address review feedback. Your commits should tell a story.
* If necessary, tidy up your git commit history once your PR is approved.

Thank you for reading through our contributing guide! We appreciate you taking
the time to ensure your contributions are high quality and easy for our
community to review and accept. Please don't hesitate to [reach out to
